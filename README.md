# FQT

> Tiny (67 lines of code!) template engine with the same syntax as EJS

FQT is a template engine with the same syntax as [EJS](https://ejs.co/). It only supports the two most important EJS tags: `<%` and `<%=`. Another difference is that FQT does not automatically HTML-escape values in `<%=` tags.

This is more of an experiment of mine.
